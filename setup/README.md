# Setup

This script assumes you:
- Are running Debian 10
- Have the `sudo` and `git` packages installed
- Are running it as a normal user that is a member of the `sudo` group

This code snippet will clone this repo to `~/apollo` and run the setup script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/psidex/simonjenner.me ~/apollo && cd ~/apollo/setup && sudo bash setup
```
